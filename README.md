# particeTest
simple particle system I originally made for something else using c++ and sfml
it has become much more than I planned for it to be, but overall I am happy with it
sometimes it will take nearly 10 seconds to launch, I might try fix that sometime
not every demo might have a compiled binary, even the compiled binaries are linux only because i dont feel like compiling on a different computer for something so simple
